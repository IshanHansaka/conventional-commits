Have you ever looked at a Git commit history and struggled to understand what changes were made? Take a look at this example commit history:

```
commit 1a2b3c4 - update
commit 2b3c4d5 - fixing bugs
commit 3c4d5e6 - changes
```

Messy Git commits make it hard to understand what changes were made, especially when messages like "update" or "fixing bugs" donâ€™t explain anything. This makes finding and fixing bugs more difficult because thereâ€™s no clear record of when a problem started. It also creates confusion for team members, slowing down work since no one knows what each commit actually does.

## The Solution? Conventional Commits!

By adopting Conventional Commits, you can transform this commit history into a well-structured and readable one. Instead of vague messages, use clear and meaningful commit types, like this:

```
feat(auth): add login functionality
fix(ui): resolve button alignment issue
chore: update dependencies
```

With this approach, every commit has a purpose and can be easily understood!

## What Are Conventional Commits?

Conventional Commits are a standardized way to write commit messages. They follow a specific format to make commits more readable and meaningful. A commit message typically follows this structure:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

Each commit consists of three parts:

1. **Type** â€” Describes the category of the change (e.g., feat, fix, chore, docs).
2. **Scope (Optional)** â€” Indicates the specific module or component affected.
3. **Message** â€” Provides a brief description of the change.

### Example:

```
feat(auth): add login functionality
fix: resolve button alignment issue
chore: update dependencies
```

## Commonly Used Commit Types

- **feat** â€” Introduces a new feature
  ```
  feat: add dark mode support
  ```
- **fix** â€” Fixes a bug
  ```
  fix: resolve crash on login
  ```
- **chore** â€” Maintains the codebase without modifying production code
  ```
  chore: delete unused assets and images
  ```
- **docs** â€” Updates documentation
  ```
  docs: add API usage guide
  ```
- **refactor** â€” Improves code structure without changing functionality
  ```
  refactor: optimize sorting algorithm
  ```
- **test** â€” Adds or updates tests
  ```
  test: add unit tests for auth module
  ```
- **style** â€” Updates formatting, indentation, or whitespace
  ```
  style: update button color
  ```
- **perf** â€” Improves performance
  ```
  perf: reduce image load time
  ```
- **build** â€” Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies
  ```
  build: update Webpack config to support ES6 modules
  ```
- **ci** â€” Changes to CI configuration files and scripts
  ```
  ci: add GitHub Actions workflow for automated testing
  ```

## How to Use Conventional Commits

When making a commit, follow this structure:

```sh
git add <changed_file_path>
git commit -m "feat: add animation for modal"
```

## Why Use Conventional Commits?

âœ… **Clearer Commit History** â€” By following a structured format, developers can easily understand what each commit does.

âœ… **Better Collaboration** â€” Team members can quickly identify changes and their impact.

âœ… **Automated Releases** â€” Many tools like Semantic Release can automate versioning based on commit types.

âœ… **Improved Documentation** â€” Changelogs become more readable and can be auto-generated.

## Summary

By adopting Conventional Commits, you ensure that your commit history remains clean, structured, and useful. Whether you work solo or in a team, these guidelines help in tracking changes, debugging issues, and automating workflows efficiently.
